  - 'I''ve built a weapon here, it''s a simple freeze ray. Don''t ask me to explain
    how it works, but here''s a cartridge. Whatever it is outside this train it''s
    cold, really cold, and it''s not normal matter like we''re used to. I''ve captrued
    some of it and managed to trap it inside these cartridges, there are only a few,
    so be sparing.  '
  - 'I had the idea of freezing the train''s engine, I managed to sneak my way up
    there once, and could see it''s well hot, way beyond what should be normal. If
    someone can get up there with the freeze ray, I''m betting hitting it with this
    will put some serious cool down on the engine, and maybe stop this madness.  '
  - 'That being said, I''m not sure there are enough cartridges to completely freeze
    the engine, and there are no more materials I can use to capture more.  '
