  - 'You''re new to the train, I can tell! you don''t look as tired as the rest of
    us, I can see that by looking at your eyes! but you''ve seen things, I can tell
    that, just another day in life for you, huh? '
  - 'You might know it all already kid, but let me lay out the land for ya.  You
    already know the trains a loop, we figured that out by looking out back, there''s
    an engine pushing us, which is the wrong place the the engine to be.  We been
    passing the same damn trees and lights this whole time, it''s just a damn loop. '
  - If you're going to do anything about this, and you might know more than we do,
    but you're going to have to get us off this loop, decouple these carriages from
    the engine and split us off from the rest of the train.  I don't know how you
    gonna pull that off, but that's the consensus from the people in this train.
